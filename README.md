# Flask-Authentication
In this Flask project, I've delved into a comprehensive exploration of user authentication, registration, login, and access control mechanisms. Through hands-on development, I've acquired proficiency in:

1. Flask framework for web development
2. SQLAlchemy for managing user data and database operations
3. Hashing passwords with Werkzeug for secure storage
4. Session management using Flask-Login
5. Implementing access control with login_required decorators

This project has not only deepened my understanding of Flask's capabilities but also provided invaluable experience in building robust web applications with user authentication features.
